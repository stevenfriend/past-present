      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <p>The following exercises are designed to help the students understand simple past tense verb conjugation. The first two exercises in the menu cover simple present tense. The third and fourth exercises explain simple past tense. The fifth exercise asks the students to use the past tense for the same phrases they were taught in second activity.</p>
      <h3>Simple Present Tense: Table</h3>
      <p>The students are reminded of what a verb is and are shown 20 common English verbs. The table can be used to hide the English or Japanese words by clicking on the eye at the top or by clicking on individual words. You can use the table to test whether the students know the verbs.</p>
      <h3>Simple Present Tense: Phrases</h3>
      <p>
        The students are shown the same 20 verbs being used in context. Once the students have been introduced to the phrases the English verb or whole phrase can be hidden. Ask the students to tell you the verb that was used in each phrase. For more advanced students ask them to tell you the whole phrase. 
        Note: Remind the students that directly translating the phrases/verbs should often be avoided. Instead, they should think about how the phrases would be spoken naturally in English.
      </p>
      <h3>Simple Past Tense: Regular Verbs</h3>
      <p>
        Explain to the students how to conjugate regular verbs in the simple past tense. Help the students understand how to pronounce the ‘ed’ ending as /t/, /d/ or /id/. There are five examples for each pronunciation. You can test the students by hiding the columns of the table and clicking on the cells to reveal the answer.      </p>
